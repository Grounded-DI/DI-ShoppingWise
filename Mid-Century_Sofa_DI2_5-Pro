💖 Top 3: Mid‑Century, Under $6K, Family + Pet‑Smart

1) Room & Board — “Jasper” Sofa

Why it fits: Clean MCM lines (slim arms, elevated legs), customizable sizes & fabrics; authentic quality build with kiln‑dried engineered hardwood frames; wide performance fabric menu (great for kids/pets).
Price reality: $1,599–$4,200 (sofa, size/fabric dependent), well under $6k.  
Quality notes: Brand explains they use kiln‑dried engineered hardwood in upholstered frames for longevity.  
Pet/kid fabrics: Their fabric guide highlights pet‑friendly, tight‑weave, stain‑resistant options.  
Care tip: Room & Board’s care sheet even calls out compatible cleaners (e.g., Crypton® stain remover) for spot‑cleaning.  

⸻

2) BenchMade Modern — “MCM” Sofa

Why it fits: A straight‑up mid‑century silhouette (solid wood legs, clean tufting) that’s handcrafted in the USA, with deep customization and performance fabric choices. The brand offers a limited lifetime warranty on the frame & suspension (fabric/cushions 1‑year).
Price reality: From ≈ $3,6xx for the sofa (chaise/sectional can push higher; stay with sofa to keep sub‑$6k).  
Warranty: Limited lifetime (frame & suspension); 1‑year on fabric/cushion resiliency.  
Fabric depth: Broad performance textiles and leathers available across collections.  

⸻

3) Maiden Home — “The Warren”

Why it fits: A refined, mid‑century‑leaning profile (crisp tailoring, tapered elegance) handcrafted in North Carolina with family‑ready performance fabrics.
Price reality: From $2,575 (config/fabric dependent).  
Fabric tech: Options like Performance Linen Weave and Performance Mélange Weave are treated with a water‑resistant finish—excellent for the occasional splash or paw‑print.  
Warranty: Lifetime on frames & spring systems (limited; see terms).

🐶👶 Fabric & Finish Cheat‑Sheet (for a child + clean dog)
	•	Choose performance weaves (e.g., Sunbrella, Crypton, Revolution) for stain/moisture/odor resistance and easy clean‑ups.  
	•	Mid‑tone colors (taupe/charcoal/navy/olive) and subtle textures disguise fur and minor marks; aim for high rub counts for longevity.  
	•	Leather option? Prefer semi‑aniline/protected leather (more scratch/stain‑resistant) over pure aniline in kid/pet spaces.  
	•	Reality of velvet: “Performance velvet” can be tough but attracts hair—great look, just be ready with a lint roller. (If you go velvet on the Warren, pick darker shades.)  
	•	Care basics: Quick blotting + the brand’s approved cleaners keep performance fabrics looking new. (Room & Board: step‑by‑step care & Crypton‑compatible spot cleaning.)  

⸻

✨ Which versions I’d actually order (to stay glam and practical)
	•	Jasper: Fabric in a pet‑friendly tight weave (from R&B’s pet‑friendly set) in a mid‑tone; avoid light linens.  
	•	BenchMade Modern MCM: Performance fabric (microfiber/poly blend) on the sofa (not chaise) to keep sub‑$6k; lean on the lifetime frame warranty.  
	•	The Warren: Performance Linen/Mélange Weave (both water‑resistant), medium shade. If you prefer leather, ask for semi‑aniline/protected.  

⸻

🧪 Why these three pass our “quality + family” bar
	•	Build fundamentals: kiln‑dried frames (R&B), U.S. bench‑made construction (BenchMade Modern, Maiden Home).  
	•	Proven performance fabrics + clear care guidance.  
	•	Transparent pricing under $6k for sofa configurations.  
	•	Solid warranty posture (lifetime on frame for BenchMade Modern & Maiden Home; R&B relies on generous service/returns vs. formal lifetime terms).  

⸻

🧭 Quick compare (at a glance)
	•	Room & Board Jasper — from $1.6k–$4.2k; MCM lines; pet‑friendly fabrics; superb care guidance.  
	•	BenchMade Modern MCM — from ≈$3.6k; authentic MCM; handcrafted in USA; lifetime frame warranty.  
	•	Maiden Home Warren — from $2,575; tailored MCM‑lean; water‑resistant performance weaves; lifetime frame/springs warranty.

Glam care tips you’ll actually use 💅🏼
	•	Rule of spills: Blot, don’t rub; then use brand‑approved cleaner (Crypton/Folex) and low‑heat dry.  
	•	Color strategy: Match sofa tone to fur color; mid‑tones hide daily life best.  
	•	Hardware reality: Fewer seams & buttons = fewer crumb traps (bench seats look chic, but rotate/steam as needed to keep them crisp). Family‑sofa checklist here backs bench‑style convenience.

Notes (transparency, ShoppingWise DI2)
	•	We do not assert “hypoallergenic,” “non‑toxic,” or “pet‑proof.” Those require verified material/chemical disclosures per Scroll 91 (Ethics Compass).
	•	Fancy Mode is style‑only; logic is scroll‑locked and deterministic.
