Overview:
This Oat Delicacy Soothing Shampoo is crafted with Oat Milk and Rice Cream, ensuring gentle hydration and scalp care—perfect for sensitive scalps, with up to 72 hours of moisture when paired with its conditioner. It’s vegan, cruelty‑free (Leaping Bunny certified), and free from silicones, parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, and DMDM hydantoin. ￼ ￼

Ingredients Review:
	•	Contains Oat Kernel Extract (colloidal oatmeal) and Rice Starch, both recognized for soothing, emollient properties. ￼
	•	Includes common surfactants like Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulfate for cleansing, mixed with Cocamidopropyl Betaine for gentler action. ￼
	•	Also has Salicylic Acid (mild exfoliant/preservative), Aloe Vera, and Glycerin for hydration. ￼ ￼
	•	Fragrance components (Limonene, Linalool, Coumarin, etc.) are potential irritants for very sensitive users. ￼

Safety & Hazard Rating:
EWG has assessed this formula—but without showing a numeric score here. However, ingredient transparency and dermatologist/allergy testing suggest moderate safety. ￼

User Sentiment:
Generally positive experiences—users report soft, shiny hair and no scalp issues.
One noted experience from a reviewer: slightly itchy ears from fragrance and certain chemicals, so caution is advised for ultra-sensitive areas. ￼

Overall Fancy Conclusion:
Glowing soft locks and scalp comfort await! The shampoo shines with natural oat and rice goodness, yet the fragrance suite may need a pass for ultra-sensitive users. Go ahead—just patch-test if you’re in hypersensitivity territory. Certainty: 85 • Hallucination Risk: Low • Source Type: Secondary.
